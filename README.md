If you accidentally close the Google Keep view, or it doesn't open when you first install the plugin, you can open it again with the `Obsidian Keep: Open Keep` command.

By default, the plugin also ships with a set of custom CSS that is applied to Google Keep to make it work better as a narrow side view rather than a full page.
